# Preamble

##Instructions
This code is written in chunks that each accomplish a task moving towards the goal of a file for each state that encompasses all fish observations made/shared with us. The structure of that observation-level data should be one row per individual fish. By joining these data to the effort info, we will be able to filter and aggregate the data in flexible ways, always bringing along info on how much effort it took to catch each the fish obs (or set of fish).

The data explainer sticks .n suffixes on columns where multiple fields from one of the datastes has multiple cols that match that field (i.e., date.1, date.2, date.3). The naming conventions for cols uses "_" and no spaces.

After loading packages, the data from each state will be loaded into the WS and renamed according to the mapping of old colnames to new colnames in the data explainer. Next, the files should be explored a bit, and the script should identify files that will not be used, but instead get removed from the workspace. After this initial exploration fo what's there, the files should be restructured and munged into the obs-level format described above. When this is done, subsequent blocks should conduct some baseline additional QC should be done to verify the product of the munging is as-expected. Finally, the script should tidy up an remaining column or field formatting (e.g., species uses common names, no spaces, but "_"), and drop an unneeded columns. 


A basic guide to columns we expect to see in a observation level data are as follows:

LOCATION INFORMATION:
state - 
county - county associate with the wb in the state data
lake_name - common lang name of the lake
lake_id - usually a local id specific to the state contributing the data
nhdhr.id - This column is usually added towards the end of the script based on state lake_ids using the mwlaxeref (Paul Frater) package from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HURmPTtufVzI0aqn7D8MpKdL5B8atCL5

SURVEY INFORMATION:
date_clean - usually multiple dates are submitted with each fish (e.g., collection date, survey end date). Use the date of the survey as the primary date for each fish observation, generating a date_clean column
survey_type - this is often specified in the data, and sometimes helps to filter out which data are useful for any given purpose (e.g., research survey, fishkill check)
survey_id - in some states this is a provided variable used as a key to each "survey." Ususally a "survey" is multiple gears on a single lake on a single date (often surveys might run multiple consecutive dates, but only one date is reported )
sampling_method - This is a gear field, and often includes wide ranging gears and sometimes very specific gears
total_effort.1 - This should be a numeric field with only the qty of effort
effort_units.1 - paired with total_effort.1, defines units for numeric
nothing_caught - specifies that nothing was caught in this effort (species will also be NA)
target_species - what was the species being targeted in the survey?
effort_ident - This is a field we add, it is a unique key for each effort unit that we have data for(usually a gear within a survey). For example, a data user could get cpue by counting all fish within a group_by(effort_id) or it's equivalent group_by(lake_id, date, survey_type,sampling_method) 

TAXA INFORMATION: 
species.1 - species common name
species_abbrev - State level code sometimes used in data share
length.1 - length of fish observed, numeric
length_unit.1 - units for length.1, also specify resolution if needed (e.g, cm, whole cm)
weight.1 - weight of fish obs, numeric
weight_unit.1 - units of weight.1, also specify resolution if needed (e.g, lb, whole lb)
sample_id.1 - unique id for each fish observation sometimes provided and sometimes useful for connecting to aged fish
age - age in years, numeric
aging_structure - what was used to determine age?
young_of_year - was the fish a YOY (i.e. hatched <365d before surveyed)
sex - sex of fish (male, female, unknown, NA)

SOURCE FILE INFORMATION: These columns come in with each dataset from the data explainer and we leave them in the product so that we could hunt down issues we find a bit more easily. 

original_file_name.1_effort - name of effort file that was used to generate data in this row
original_file_name.1_indivfish - name of individual fish file that was used to generate data in this row
original_file_name.1_[...]

FLAGS AND ISSUES:
flag - this column contains a character string with issues describing each row, each issue separated with a comma. Use mutate(flag = paste(flag, "new issue description", sep = ",")) to add to this column without overwriting other issues already specified.

# Update 7/22/24 (Denver)
I ran into an issue in the parquet file where total effort ident "1" had no survey level info. I did some exploration and found it was due to poor survey id crosswalks between the individual fish object and the effort object. The survey id linkage was 1.) null in fish obs or 2.) survey id in fish was not found in the effort object. The surveys causing issue were removed. They must be removed because they were creating an erroneous total effort ident grouping for the surveys that just didn't have any info

#Data Review

#clean out some file import stuff-
rm(cde,names, unusedbits, cols, filei, files_list, i, maxn, n)

# review each dataset that we have, strategizing about how you'll use them to develop a obs-level file
# consider things like species scope (do I need to restrict all input data to just the 8ish game species?), file organization (is this file already in a obs-level format or is it a count of each species/size that I should uncount()?), linking keys (is there a fish obs ID in the age data that I can use to link to the fish observations data?), and what things (posisbly whole datasets) are unneeded for our work, here. I have left the Michigan work in here to give you an idea of what I did:
